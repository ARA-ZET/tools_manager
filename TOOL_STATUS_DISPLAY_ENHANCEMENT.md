# Tool Detail Screen Status Display Enhancement

## Overview

Enhanced the tool detail screen to show **comprehensive status information** for both checked-out and available tools, with smart fallbacks for legacy tools.

## Status Display Logic

### For Checked Out Tools

The "Current Status" section now shows:

1. **Status Badge**: Orange "Checked Out" indicator
2. **Assigned To**: Staff member name
   - First tries: `tool.lastAssignedToName` (instant field)
   - Fallback: Loads from `tool.currentHolder` reference (legacy tools)
   - Shows loading spinner while fetching
   - Last resort: Shows partial staff UID
3. **Job Code**: Worker's job code (e.g., "W1234")
   - From: `tool.lastAssignedToJobCode`
   - Or: `_legacyStatusInfo` after loading
4. **Assigned By**: Admin who authorized checkout
   - From: `tool.lastAssignedByName`
5. **Checked Out**: Timestamp of when tool was checked out
   - From: `tool.lastAssignedAt`
   - Fallback: "Date not recorded" for legacy tools

### For Available Tools

The "Current Status" section now shows:

1. **Status Badge**: Green "Available" indicator
2. **Last Returned By**: Who returned the tool
   - From: `tool.lastCheckinByName`
3. **Returned At**: When it was returned
   - From: `tool.lastCheckinAt`
   - Fallback: "Ready For Use" message with checkmark
4. **Previously Assigned To**: Last person who had it
   - From: `tool.lastAssignedToName`
   - Shows history icon to indicate past assignment

## Example Displays

### Checked Out Tool (New System)

```
Current Status
├─ Status: Checked Out (orange)
├─ Assigned To: John Doe 👤
├─ Job Code: W1234 🎫
├─ Assigned By: Admin Smith 👨‍💼
└─ Checked Out: Oct 20, 2025 at 02:30 PM 🕐
```

### Checked Out Tool (Legacy - No Instant Fields)

```
Current Status
├─ Status: Checked Out (orange)
├─ Assigned To: Loading... ⟳
├─ [After loading] Assigned To: John Doe 👤
└─ Checked Out: Date not recorded 🕐
```

### Available Tool (New System)

```
Current Status
├─ Status: Available (green)
├─ Last Returned By: John Doe ↩️
├─ Returned At: Oct 20, 2025 at 04:45 PM 🕐
└─ Previously Assigned To: John Doe 📜
```

### Available Tool (Legacy - No History)

```
Current Status
├─ Status: Available (green)
└─ Ready For Use: Available for checkout ✓
```

## Technical Implementation

### Legacy Status Loading

For tools checked out before the instant fields were added:

```dart
Future<void> _loadLegacyStatusInfo() async {
  // Only load if instant fields are missing
  if (widget.tool.lastAssignedToName != null) {
    return; // New fields exist, skip
  }

  // Fetch staff from currentHolder reference
  if (widget.tool.currentHolder != null) {
    final staff = await _staffService.getStaffById(
      widget.tool.currentHolder!.id
    );

    setState(() {
      _legacyStatusInfo = {
        'assignedTo': staff?.fullName ?? 'Unknown Staff',
        'assignedToJobCode': staff?.jobCode ?? 'Unknown',
      };
    });
  }
}
```

### Smart Display Logic

```dart
// Try instant field first
if (widget.tool.lastAssignedToName != null)
  _InfoRow('Assigned To', widget.tool.lastAssignedToName!)
// Try legacy info next
else if (_legacyStatusInfo != null)
  _InfoRow('Assigned To', _legacyStatusInfo!['assignedTo']!)
// Show loading state
else if (_loadingLegacyStatus)
  _InfoRow('Assigned To', 'Loading...', spinner)
// Last resort: show partial ID
else if (widget.tool.currentHolder != null)
  _InfoRow('Assigned To', 'Staff Member (ID: abc12...)')
```

## Benefits

✅ **Complete Information**: Always shows maximum available status info
✅ **Graceful Degradation**: Handles legacy tools smoothly
✅ **Loading States**: Shows spinner for async operations
✅ **User Friendly**: Clear, readable status for both states
✅ **No Empty Screens**: Always shows something useful
✅ **Backward Compatible**: Works with old and new data

## Migration Path

### New Checkouts

- All fields populated immediately
- Instant display (no loading)
- Full status information

### Legacy Checkouts

- On first view: Loads from `currentHolder` reference (~200-500ms)
- Shows loading spinner during fetch
- Displays full name + job code after loading
- On next checkout/checkin: Gets upgraded to instant fields automatically

### Never Checked Out

- Shows "Ready For Use" message
- Green status indicator
- No historical data (as expected)

## User Experience

### Before Enhancement

```
Current Status
└─ Status: Checked Out
   [End of section - user confused about who has it]
```

### After Enhancement

```
Current Status
├─ Status: Checked Out
├─ Assigned To: John Doe
├─ Job Code: W1234
├─ Assigned By: Admin Smith
└─ Checked Out: Oct 20, 2025 at 02:30 PM

[User knows exactly who has tool, when, and who authorized it]
```

## Testing Checklist
