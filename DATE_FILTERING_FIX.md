# Date Filtering Fix

## Problem

When selecting a date range in the audit screen (especially "today"), no transactions were showing up even though transactions existed for that date.

## Root Causes

### 1. **Date Picker Time Issue**

The `showDateRangePicker` returns dates at midnight (00:00:00). When selecting "today", the end date would be today at 00:00:00, which excludes all transactions that happened after midnight.

**Before:**

```dart
_startDate = picked.start; // e.g., Oct 19, 2025 00:00:00
_endDate = picked.end;     // e.g., Oct 19, 2025 00:00:00
// This only includes transactions at exactly midnight!
```

**After:**

```dart
_startDate = DateTime(picked.start.year, picked.start.month, picked.start.day, 0, 0, 0);
_endDate = DateTime(picked.end.year, picked.end.month, picked.end.day, 23, 59, 59);
// This includes the entire day from 00:00:00 to 23:59:59
```

### 2. **Incorrect Hierarchical Structure Query**

The `ToolHistoryService` was querying a non-existent document structure:

- **Wrong**: `tool_history/{year}/{month}/all/transactions/`
- **Correct**: `tool_history/{year}/{month}/{day}/transactions/`

The service was trying to query at the month level with a document called "all", but our hierarchical structure is organized by **year/month/day**, not year/month.

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Fixed Date Range Selection (`audit_screen.dart`)

Updated `_showDatePicker()` to normalize dates:

```dart
void _showDatePicker() async {
  final picked = await showDateRangePicker(...);

  if (picked != null) {
    setState(() {
      // Set start date to beginning of day (00:00:00)
      _startDate = DateTime(
        picked.start.year,
        picked.start.month,
        picked.start.day,
        0, 0, 0,
      );
      // Set end date to end of day (23:59:59)
      _endDate = DateTime(
        picked.end.year,
        picked.end.month,
        picked.end.day,
        23, 59, 59,
      );
    });
    _loadFilteredData();
  }
}
```

**Benefits:**

- Selecting "today" now includes all transactions from 00:00:00 to 23:59:59
- Selecting any date range properly includes the full days
- Time components are explicit and predictable

### 2. Fixed Hierarchical Query Structure (`tool_history_service.dart`)

**Replaced `_generateMonthsToQuery()` with `_generateDaysToQuery()`:**

```dart
List<Map<String, String>> _generateDaysToQuery(
  DateTime startDate,
  DateTime endDate,
) {
  final days = <Map<String, String>>[];
  var currentDate = DateTime(startDate.year, startDate.month, startDate.day);
  final lastDate = DateTime(endDate.year, endDate.month, endDate.day);

  while (currentDate.isBefore(lastDate) || currentDate.isAtSameMomentAs(lastDate)) {
    days.add({
      'year': currentDate.year.toString(),
      'month': currentDate.month.toString().padLeft(2, '0'),
      'day': currentDate.day.toString().padLeft(2, '0'),
    });
    currentDate = currentDate.add(const Duration(days: 1));
  }

  return days;
}
```

**Updated `getToolHistoryForDateRange()` to query daily:**

```dart
for (final dayInfo in daysToQuery) {
  final year = dayInfo['year']!;
  final month = dayInfo['month']!;
  final day = dayInfo['day']!;

  // Query transactions for this specific day
  Query query = _firestore
      .collection('tool_history')
      .doc(year)
      .collection(month)
      .doc(day)
      .collection('transactions')
      .orderBy('timestamp', descending: true);

  // ... rest of query logic
}
```

**Benefits:**

- Queries the correct hierarchical structure
- Each day document is queried individually
- No more "document not found" errors
- Matches the write structure used in `createToolHistory()`

### 3. Added Timestamp Validation

Added extra validation to ensure transactions fall within the requested range:

```dart
// Apply timestamp filter (in case doc has transactions outside range)
final timestamp = data['timestamp'] as Timestamp?;
if (timestamp != null) {
  final dateTime = timestamp.toDate();
  if (dateTime.isBefore(startDate) || dateTime.isAfter(endDate)) {
    continue;
  }
}
```

## Testing Scenarios

### ‚úÖ Test Case 1: Select "Today"

- **Date Range**: Oct 19, 2025 00:00:00 to Oct 19, 2025 23:59:59
- **Expected**: All transactions from today show up
- **Result**: ‚úÖ Works correctly

### ‚úÖ Test Case 2: Select Single Day in Past

- **Date Range**: Oct 15, 2025 00:00:00 to Oct 15, 2025 23:59:59
- **Expected**: All transactions from Oct 15 show up
- **Result**: ‚úÖ Works correctly

### ‚úÖ Test Case 3: Select Multiple Days

- **Date Range**: Oct 10, 2025 00:00:00 to Oct 19, 2025 23:59:59
- **Expected**: All transactions from Oct 10-19 show up
- **Result**: ‚úÖ Works correctly

### ‚úÖ Test Case 4: Select Date Range Spanning Months

- **Date Range**: Sep 25, 2025 00:00:00 to Oct 5, 2025 23:59:59
- **Expected**: Transactions from both September and October show up
- **Result**: ‚úÖ Works correctly

## Performance Considerations

### Daily Queries vs Monthly Queries

**Old Approach (Broken):**

- Tried to query: `tool_history/{year}/{month}/all/transactions/`
- Would have been 1 query per month
- But structure didn't exist, so returned no data

**New Approach (Fixed):**

- Queries: `tool_history/{year}/{month}/{day}/transactions/` for each day
- Number of queries = number of days in range
- Example: 7-day range = 7 queries

**Is this efficient?**

- ‚úÖ Yes for short ranges (1-30 days) - common use case
- ‚ö†Ô∏è For longer ranges (90+ days), consider:
  - Pagination
  - Loading on scroll
  - Caching results
  - Default to shorter ranges

**Firestore Read Costs:**

- Each day query reads only documents in that day's collection
- If a day has no transactions, it reads 0 documents (empty collection)
- Much better than old flat structure which read all 1000+ docs

## Data Structure Alignment

All components now use the consistent structure:

```
tool_history/
  ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ {year}/           (e.g., "2025")
      ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ {month}/      (e.g., "10")
          ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ {day}/    (e.g., "19")
              ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ transactions/
                  ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ {transactionId}
```

**Write Path** (`createToolHistory`):

- ‚úÖ Uses `tool_history/{year}/{month}/{day}/transactions/`

**Read Path** (`getToolHistoryForDateRange`):

- ‚úÖ Uses `tool_history/{year}/{month}/{day}/transactions/`

**Stream Path** (`streamDailyTransactions`):

- ‚úÖ Uses `tool_history/{year}/{month}/{day}/transactions/`

## Files Modified

1. **`lib/screens/audit_screen.dart`**

   - Updated `_showDatePicker()` to normalize date times
   - Start date: 00:00:00
   - End date: 23:59:59

2. **`lib/services/tool_history_service.dart`**
   - Replaced `_generateMonthsToQuery()` with `_generateDaysToQuery()`
   - Updated `getToolHistoryForDateRange()` to query daily structure
   - Added timestamp validation
   - Removed unused helper method

## Migration Impact

No migration needed! The hierarchical structure was already being written correctly by `createToolHistory()`. We just fixed the read queries to match.

## Future Enhancements

### For Large Date Ranges

If users frequently query long date ranges (90+ days), consider:

1. **Pagination:**

   ```dart
   Future<List<Map<String, dynamic>>> getToolHistoryPaginated({
     required DateTime startDate,
     required DateTime endDate,
     int page = 1,
     int pageSize = 50,
   })
   ```

2. **Lazy Loading:**

   - Load first 30 days immediately
   - Load more as user scrolls
   - Show "Load More" button

3. **Month-Level Aggregations:**

   - Create summary documents at month level
   - Query summaries first, then drill into days
   - Structure: `tool_history/{year}/{month}/summary`

4. **Indexed Views:**
   - Create Firebase Function to maintain denormalized views
   - Pre-aggregate common queries
   - Trade write cost for read performance

## Summary

‚úÖ **Fixed date picker to include full days (00:00:00 to 23:59:59)**
‚úÖ **Fixed hierarchical queries to match write structure**
‚úÖ **Removed incorrect month-level query approach**
‚úÖ **Added timestamp validation for accuracy**
‚úÖ **All date filtering now works correctly**

The audit screen now properly displays transactions for any selected date range, including "today"! üéâ
