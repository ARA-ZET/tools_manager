## Test Plan

### Test 1: New Tool Checkout (Subcollection Write)

**Objective:** Verify that checking out a tool creates entries in the tool subcollection.

**Steps:**

1. **Navigate to Tools screen**

   - Tap "Tools" in bottom navigation

2. **Select an available tool**

   - Tap on any tool with "Available" status
   - Note the tool ID (e.g., T2973)

3. **Go to Scan screen**

   - Tap "Scan" in bottom navigation
   - Tap "Manual Entry" or scan the tool's QR code
   - Enter tool ID if using manual entry

4. **Check out the tool**

   - Select a staff member from the list
   - Tap "Check Out"
   - Wait for success message

5. **Verify console logs**

Expected output:

```
‚úÖ Tool subcollection history created: tools/{toolId}/history/10-2025 (1 transactions)
‚úÖ Tool history created: tool_history/10-2025/days/20 (1 transactions)
```

6. **Check Firestore Console**
   - Open Firebase Console ‚Üí Firestore
   - Navigate to: `tools/{toolId}/history/10-2025`
   - Verify document exists with:
     - `monthKey: "10-2025"`
     - `transactions: [...]` array with 1 entry
   - Verify transaction contains:
     - `id`
     - `action: "checkout"`
     - `byStaffUid`
     - `assignedToStaffUid`
     - `timestamp`
     - `metadata` with names

**‚úÖ Pass Criteria:**

- Console logs show subcollection write
- Firestore document exists
- Transactions array contains checkout entry
- Metadata includes readable names

---

### Test 2: Tool Detail - History Tab (Subcollection Read)

**Objective:** Verify that the tool detail screen reads from the subcollection.

**Steps:**

1. **Open tool detail screen**

   - From Tools list, tap on the tool you just checked out

2. **View Details tab**

   - Verify instant fields are displayed:
     - "Assigned To: [Staff Name]"
     - "Job Code: [Job Code]"
     - "Assigned By: [Admin Name]"
     - "Checked Out: [Timestamp]"

3. **Switch to History tab**

   - Tap "History" tab

4. **Verify console logs**

Expected output:

```
üìä Loading history from tool subcollection for tool: {toolId}
üìä Querying tool {toolId} history for 3 months
  ‚úÖ Found 1 transactions for 10-2025
  ‚ö†Ô∏è No history for month 09-2025
  ‚ö†Ô∏è No history for month 08-2025
‚úÖ Loaded 1 transactions for tool {toolId}
```

5. **Verify UI shows history**
   - Should see checkout entry card with:
     - "Check Out" title
     - Timestamp
     - "Assigned to: [Staff Name]"
     - "Processed by: [Admin Name]"

**‚úÖ Pass Criteria:**

- Console shows querying 3 months (current + 2 previous)
- History card displays with readable names
- No error messages
- Loading completes in < 1 second

---

### Test 3: Check In Tool (Second Subcollection Entry)

**Objective:** Verify check-in creates second entry in subcollection array.

**Steps:**

1. **Go to Scan screen**

   - Scan or manually enter the same tool

2. **Check in the tool**

   - Select "Check In" (or scan while tool is checked out)
   - Tap "Check In" button
   - Wait for success message

3. **Verify console logs**

Expected output:

```
‚úÖ Tool subcollection history created: tools/{toolId}/history/10-2025 (2 transactions)
‚úÖ Tool history created: tool_history/10-2025/days/20 (2 transactions)
```

4. **Check Firestore Console**

   - Navigate to: `tools/{toolId}/history/10-2025`
   - Verify `transactions` array now has 2 entries:
     - First: `action: "checkout"`
     - Second: `action: "checkin"`

5. **Return to tool detail screen**
   - History tab should now show 2 entries
   - Most recent (checkin) should be at top

**‚úÖ Pass Criteria:**

- Console shows 2 transactions in subcollection
- Firestore shows 2 entries in array
- History tab displays both entries
- Checkin appears above checkout (newest first)

---

### Test 4: Batch Operations (Batch ID Tracking)

**Objective:** Verify batch operations include batchId in subcollection.

**Steps:**

1. **Enable batch mode**

   - In Scan screen, tap batch mode toggle

2. **Scan multiple tools**

   - Scan 3-5 different tools
   - They should accumulate in the batch list

3. **Batch checkout**

   - Select a staff member

   - Wait for success

4. **Verify console logs**

Expected output for each tool:

```
‚úÖ Tool subcollection history created: tools/{toolId}/history/10-2025 (X transactions)
üè∑Ô∏è Batch ID: BATCH_1729512345000
```

5. **Check Firestore Console**

   - Open any of the batched tools: `tools/{toolId}/history/10-2025`
   - Verify latest transaction has:
     - `batchId: "BATCH_..."`
     - Same batchId across all tools in the batch

6. **Check tool detail screens**
   - Open each batched tool
   - Go to History tab
   - Verify batch entry shows: "Batch: BATCH\_..."

**‚úÖ Pass Criteria:**

- All batched tools have same batchId
- Console logs show batch ID
- Firestore documents contain batchId field
- History UI displays batch information

---

### Test 5: Legacy Tool Fallback

**Objective:** Verify fallback works for tools without subcollection history.

**Steps:**

1. **Find or create an old tool**

   - Look for a tool that existed before subcollections
   - Or temporarily rename a tool's history subcollection in Firestore

2. **Open tool detail screen**

   - Navigate to the old tool

3. **Switch to History tab**

4. **Verify console logs**

Expected output:

```
üìä Loading history from tool subcollection for tool: {toolId}
‚ö†Ô∏è No subcollection history, trying legacy...
‚úÖ Loaded X entries from legacy system
```

5. **Verify UI**
   - History should still display (from legacy source)
   - Or show empty state if truly no history

**‚úÖ Pass Criteria:**

- No errors or crashes
- Graceful fallback to legacy system
- UI shows available data or empty state
- Clear console logs explaining fallback

---

### Test 6: Real-Time Updates (Streaming)

**Objective:** Verify history updates in real-time (future enhancement).

**Note:** Current implementation uses FutureBuilder, not streams. This test is for future reference.

**Steps:**

1. **Open tool detail on one device/tab**

   - View History tab

2. **Check out tool from another device/tab**

   - Use different device or browser tab

3. **Refresh history**
   - Tap refresh button on first device
   - Should show new entry

**‚úÖ Pass Criteria:**

- Manual refresh shows new entries
- No errors when refreshing
- (Future: automatic updates without refresh)

---

### Test 7: Performance Testing

**Objective:** Measure history loading performance.

**Steps:**

1. **Create tool with many transactions**

   - Check out and check in same tool 10-20 times
   - This creates ~20-40 entries in subcollection

2. **Open tool detail screen**

   - Note loading time for Details tab (should be instant)

3. **Switch to History tab**

   - Note loading time
   - Should be < 500ms

4. **Compare with old tools**
   - Open old tool (legacy system)
   - Note loading time
   - Likely 2-5 seconds

**‚úÖ Pass Criteria:**

- Details tab: < 100ms (instant)
- History tab (subcollection): < 500ms
- History tab (legacy): 2-5 seconds
- Subcollection is clearly faster

---

### Test 8: Error Handling

**Objective:** Verify graceful error handling.

**Steps:**

1. **Disconnect from internet**

   - Turn off WiFi/data

2. **Open tool detail screen**

   - Details tab should show cached data
   - History tab should show error or cached data

3. **Reconnect**

   - History should load successfully

4. **Test with invalid tool ID**
   - Manually create tool with bad ID
   - Open detail screen
   - Should show empty history, not crash

**‚úÖ Pass Criteria:**

- No crashes
- User-friendly error messages
- Retry functionality works
- Graceful degradation when offline

## Firestore Console Verification

### Check Tool Subcollection Structure

**Navigate to:**

```
tools/{toolId}/history/10-2025
```

**Expected Structure:**

```javascript
{
  monthKey: "10-2025",
  transactions: [
    {
      id: "1729512345678",
      action: "checkout",
      byStaffUid: "xyz789",
      assignedToStaffUid: "xyz789",
      batchId: "BATCH_1729512345000",
      timestamp: Timestamp(2025-10-20 08:30:00),
      metadata: {
        staffName: "John Doe",
        toolName: "Makita Drill",
        adminName: "Admin Smith"
      }
    }
  ],
  updatedAt: Timestamp
}
```

### Check Global History Structure

**Navigate to:**

```
tool_history/10-2025/days/20
```

**Expected Structure:**

```javascript
{
  monthKey: "10-2025",
  dayKey: "20",
  date: "2025-10-20",
  transactions: [
    {
      id: "1729512345678",
      toolRef: DocumentReference(tools/T2973_uid),
      toolId: "T2973_uid",
      action: "checkout",
      // ... same fields as tool subcollection
    }
  ],
  updatedAt: Timestamp
}
```
